# Awesome-Early-Exiting-Neural-Network

A paper list for early-exiting neural networks (ENN).

The idea of early exiting is firsly proposed in *ICPR16-BranchyNet: Fast Inference via Early Exiting from Deep Neural Networks*.

ENN inserts **intermediate classifiers** at various network depths, allows the **early termination** of inference for simple inputs with high-confidence predictions and encourages **efficient inference**.

ENN is also named multi-exit NN in some papers.

We categorized ENN into four types and collected corresponding papers.

+ **Architecture**
+ **Training**
+ **Tuning**
+ **Inference**

A detailed mindmap of paper collected is illustrated as follow
